</ul>

<br>
<br>

# Installing Python
Go to https://www.python.org/ and install the latest version (3.11 recomended) and make sure to add it to Path! You may need to restart afterwards.

Check if python is installed by typing `python -h` in Commmand prompt.

Python should pip <b>(Python's package manager)</b> as well, so let's check if it installed as well. To do this run `pip -h` in Command prompt. <br>
If pip as installed sucessfully, run `pip install requests pathlib`. This will install the required packages.

<br>
<br>

# Grabbing the Roblox account's cookie
For this you need <a href="http://www.editthiscookie.com/"> Edit this cookie </a> or simular to browse cookies.

Locate `.ROBLOSECURITY` and copy it's value <br>

<br><br>

**WARNING** If you log out of the account, the cookie will become invalid! Instead, set `.ROBLOSECURITY`'s value to ` `&nbsp;and click the green arrow icon on the bottom of the menu (Shown in picture above).

<br><br>

## Adding the cookie

In the cookie array, add the cookie's value as a string. <br>

<br>

To format muitple cookies, I have list an example below.

```
config = {
    "Cookies": [
        ".ROBLOSECURITY Here",
        ".ROBLOSECURITY Here",
        ".ROBLOSECURITY Here"
    ]
}
```
<b> The last line should not incude a `,` at the end of the line otherwise it will result in a syntax error. </b>

After this, change the `Bot` variable to the amount of bots you want! <b>(The max amount is how many cookies you provided)</b>

<br>
<br>

# Adding the bot controler

Locate your exploit's autoexec folder and drag n drop `BotControler.lua` into it. <br>

# Botting a game

Once you have compleated the steps above, copy your Roblox's username (or a friend's) to be added to the permission list in `BotControler.lua`.
Once copyied paste it into the table and save the file. <br>

Open your exploit and MuitRBX, join the game you would like to bot. Once in the game execute a script like <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source">Infinite Yield</a> and copy the game's Jobid and paste it into the python script and reduce it to the image shown below. <br>
